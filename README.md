## Project Abstract
The News Bias Detector aims to promote media literacy by analyzing online news for bias. Utilizing advanced NLP and ML techniques, it scrutinizes text for language patterns indicating bias. This project, driven by the escalating concerns around misinformation, leverages Django for web development and Python for algorithmic analysis. Key features include URL input for scraping articles and real-time bias assessment. Development is informed by extensive research into bias detection methodologies, existing tools, and user interaction paradigms, ensuring a blend of technical proficiency and user-centric design. This tool aspires to be an essential aid for discerning readers in the digital age.

## Project Description

## User stories and User Diagrams
### User Stories
- As a person reading the news, I want to understand the bias of articles I read in order to come to my own understanding of topics I am interested in.
- As a Polysci student, I want a bias-metric to understand the mathmatical measurement of the bias in order to research more effectively.
- As a marketing professional, I want to understand the bias in news articles to help advertise correctly to the right audiences.

## Project Tasks and Timeline
### Task List
- Create a formalized outline of webpage mapping and universal styling for all webpages
- Create webscraper that analyizes the news article website URL and scrapes the article text accuratly
- Create Machine Learning Natural Language Processing feature that can correctly detect bias in the scraped news article
- Create bias metric with Machine Learning to understand how bias or unbias the news article is and present the metric intuitivly to user.
